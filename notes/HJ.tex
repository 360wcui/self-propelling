consider the two players differencial game described by the system

\begin{align*}
\dot{z} & =f\left(z\left(t\right),u\left(t\right),d\left(t\right)\right)\\
z\left(0\right) & =x
\end{align*}

where $z\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ is the system state, $u\in\mathcal{U}$
is the control input and $d\in\mathcal{D}$ is the system disturbance.

We assume $f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\times\mathcal{U}\times\mathcal{D}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}$
is uniformly continuous, bounded, and Lipschitz continuous in $z$
for fixed $u$, and $d$, and $u\left(\cdot\right)\in\mathbb{U}$,
$d\left(\cdot\right)\in\mathbb{D}$ are measurable functions. Under
these assumptions we can guaratee the dynamical system ({*}) has unique
solution.

In this differential game, the goal of the player 2, the disturbance,
is to drive the system into some target set only using nonaticipative
strategies, as long as, the player 1, the control, aims to drive the
system away from it.

we introduce the Time to reach problem as follows.

(Time-to-reach) Given an starting point $x$ find the time to reach
a target, noted by $\phi\left(x\right)$, when player 1 wants to maximize
the time, while player 2 uses a strategy to minimize the time with
knowledge of player 1's current and past decisions.

The time to reach a closed target $\Gamma\in\mathbb{R}^{n}$ with
compact boundary, given $u\left(\cdot\right)$ and $d\left(\cdot\right)$:

$T_{x}\left[u,d\right]=min\left\{ t|z\left(t\right)\in\Gamma\right\} $

The set of nonanticipo

$\Theta=\left\{ \theta:\mathbb{U}\rightarrow\mathbb{D}|u\left(\tau\right)=\hat{u}\left(\tau\right)\,\forall\tau\le t\,\text{implies\,}\theta\left[u\right]\left(\tau\right)=\theta\left[\hat{u}\right]\left(\tau\right)\,\forall\tau\le t\right\} $

Then the Time-to-reach problem is equivalent to the differential game
problem

$\phi\left(x\right)=\underset{\theta\in\Theta}{\min}\underset{u\in\mathbb{U}}{\max}T_{x}\left[u,\theta\left[u\right]\right]$

The capturability set $\mathcal{R}^{*}=\left\{ x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}|\phi\left(x\right)<+\infty\right\} $

Applying the dynamic programming principle, we can obtain $\phi$
as the viscosity solution for the following stationary HJ PDE:

\begin{align*}
\underset{u\in\mathcal{U}}{min}\underset{d\in\mathcal{D}}{max}\left\{ -\nabla\phi\left(z\right)^{\top}f\left(z,u,d\right)-1\right\}  & =0,\,\text{in}\,\mathcal{R}^{*}\backslash\Gamma\\
\phi\left(x\right) & =0,\,\text{on\,}\Gamma
\end{align*}

{[}comment on references discussing the derivation of the previous
equation{]}

From the solution $\phi\left(x\right)$ we can obtain the optimal
control for both players as:

\[
u^{*}\left(x\right)=\arg\underset{u\in\mathcal{U}}{\min}\underset{d\in\mathcal{D}}{\max}-\nabla\phi\left(z\right)^{\top}f\left(z,u,d\right)-1
\]
